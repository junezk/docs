# Draw Diagrams With Markdown

Typora supports some Markdown extension for diagrams, you could enable this feature from preference panel. 

When exporting as HTML, PDF, epub, docx, those rendered diagrams will also be included, but diagrams features are not supported when exporting markdown into other file formats in current version. Besides, you should also notice that diagrams is not supported by standard Markdown, CommonMark or GFM. Therefore, we still recommend you to insert an image of these diagrams instead of write them in Markdown directly.

# Sequence

It is powered by [js-sequence](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/), which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:

~~~gfm
​```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
​```
~~~

Please refer [here](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/#syntax) for syntax explanation.

# Flowchart

It is powered by [flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/), which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:

~~~gfm
​```flow
st=>start: Start
op=>operation: Your Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?
e=>end

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
​```

# Mermaid

Typora also has integration with [mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#mermaid), which supports sequence, flowchart and gantt.

## Sequence

see [this doc](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#sequence-diagrams)

~~~gfm
​```mermaid
%% Example of sequence diagram
  sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    alt is sick
    Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(
    else is well
    Bob->>Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy
    end
    opt Extra response
    Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking
    end
​```
