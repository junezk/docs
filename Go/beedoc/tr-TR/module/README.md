# Introduction to modules

Beego is evolving to a "LEGO model" which means becoming a modular system. Each module is one of the building blocks and you can build the application you want with these blocks. Since `Beego 1.0` these modules are listed below:

- [Session Module](./session.md)
- [Cache Module](./cache.md)
- [Logs Module](./logs.md)
- [Httplib Module](./httplib.md)
- [Context Module](./context.md)
- [Toolbox Module](./toolbox.md)
- [Config Module](./config.md)

There are also these independent modules, which are available in separate repositories:

- [i18n Module](./i18n.md)
